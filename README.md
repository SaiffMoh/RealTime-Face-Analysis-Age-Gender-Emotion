# Real-Time Emotion, Age, and Gender Detection

A deep learning-based computer vision project that detects **emotion**, **gender**, and **age** from faces in real time using webcam input.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Detects and classifies 7 emotions: `Anger`, `Disgust`, `Fear`, `Happy`, `Sad`, `Surprise`, `Neutral`
- Predicts **gender** with confidence
- Estimates **age** as a regression output
- Displays live predictions via webcam feed with bounding boxes and labels

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- `main.py`: Real-time inference script using OpenCV and TensorFlow/Keras
- `emotiongenderagedet.ipynb`: Notebook used for training and saving the models
- `models/`: Contains `.h5` trained model files for emotion, age, and gender

## ðŸ§  Models
- **Emotion Model**: CNN trained on FER2013
- **Age & Gender Models**: MobileNetV2-based models trained on UTKFace dataset
- Output saved as `.h5` and loaded in the real-time pipeline

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements
